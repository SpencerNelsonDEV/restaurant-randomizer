# Overview
A random restaurant chooser app that I am developing that will be using the Yelp Fusion API to render a choice between three random restaurants that the user can choose from. I will be using Yelp’s api restaurant data including; the restaurant located near the user’s zip code, a photo of the restaurant's street view, the yelp ratings out of five stars, yelp’s most recent user review, and the contact address/phone number.
# Expected list of components
## Form component
The user will input their area code and click a button to generate the restaurant component. I may add more advanced search options like highest rated, or by restaurant type; mexican, asian, indian, american, or others.
## Restaurant component
As stated in the overview, I will be using Yelp’s api data of restaurants. I will be using a reusable component  that will render three times, or as many or few as the user wants. The component will be rendering a card containing a random restaurant’s data that is located near the user’s zip code.
## Navigation, About, Contact components?
I’m not sure how necessary these components will be at this point.
